# Work-Day-Planner

## Description

I created a workday planner that provides the ability to write and save daily events in order to plan and organize one's work schedule and day. The scheduler features color coded time blocks so it is easy to tell in which part of the day one is currently in. Once the created events are saved, the page can be refreshed leaving the contents of the page in tact.
